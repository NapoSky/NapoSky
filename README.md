- 👋 Hi, I’m @NapoSky o7
- 👀 I’m interested in video-games, high tech and all those sort of things 👀
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, shell scripting and mostly github actions here ^^"
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing currently. I'm already working aside as a DevOps contributor to a video-game tool.
